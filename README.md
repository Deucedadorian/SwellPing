# Swell-Checker

## Description

This App uses multiple surf and weather forecasting APIs as well as straight-up data scraping techniques to create a more accurate surf forecast. It then allows the user to select their desired surf conditions. Once those are set, the app will ping the user with a phone notification or an email when the users minimum ideal conditions are met. This allows the user to no longer take time to check the various different forecasting sites they otherwise would.
